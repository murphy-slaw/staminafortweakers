# Stamina For Tweakers

A painfully configurable stamina mod.

There are a lot of stamina mods. None of them worked quite the way I wanted.

So I made this one. If it doesn't work the way you want, chances are that you can reconfigure it until it does.

## Features
So many knobs to tweak!
* Depletion rate by activity
  * Sprinting
  * Swimming
  * Jumping
  * Climbing
  * Mining blocks
* Optional, somewhat upsetting panting noises when the player is winded.
* Recovery under different conditions
  * Resting (not moving)
  * Walking
  * Sneaking
  * Underwater
  * Suffocating
* Recovery formula (linear or logarithmic)
* Exhaustion effects with configurable thresholds
  * Fatigue (like Slowness but affects climbing and swimming)
  * Darkness when completely exhausted (optional)
  * Mining fatigue (optional)
* Configurable HUD Element
  * Display as
    * Icon (indicates stamina and sprinting status)
    * Stamina Bar (horizontal or vertical)
  * Position
  * Colors
* New Potions
  * Fatigue - brewed with a Thick Potion and a Clay Ball
  * Tirelessness - completely prevents stamina depletion, brewed with a Thick Potion and a Cocoa Bean
* Traveling enchantment
  * Reduces stamina depletion for sprinting and jumping.
  * Three levels, completely nullifies stamina depletion from movement at level III.
  * Exclusive to leggings, conflicts with Swift Sneak.
* Untiring enchantment for tools
  * Reduces stamina depletion for mining
  * Three levels, completely nullifies stamina depletion from mining at level III.

With all these options, you can make stamina management anything from a mild annoyance to a nearly crippling impediment! Good times.

## Future Plans
Even more ridiculous options! Suggestions welcome on the [issues page](https://github.com/murphy-slaw/staminafortweakers/issues).
